MAH_TowerDefense
================

This is a XNA project made for "Malmö Högskolas spelutveckling program". The projects deadline is set to 15/01 2015 however it will probably be finished before that. The goal is to have a working Tower Defense game and some criterias such as the use of RenderTarget2D, pixel perfection and Spline way points.

The code is free to use however you need to put a link to this github project :) 

Other than that, happy coding!
